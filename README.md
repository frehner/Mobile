The third and final sprint of my semester long project.  The goal was to integrate an Android app with the PoS system that was created in sprints one and two, and allow a customer (on the app) to log in with their account, take a picture, upload the picture to the server, and then have the ability to view all pictures that had been taken and "purchase" prints of the pictures.  

At the end of this sprint I gave a presentation on my project to a TA, a professor, and an outside business consultant and allowed them to use the system I had built.
